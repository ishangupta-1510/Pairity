# Pairity - Dating App User Stories

## Product Vision
A premium dating platform that solves the fundamental imbalance in traditional dating apps by maintaining a 50-50 gender ratio, implementing controlled match distribution, and creating a quality-focused experience where meaningful connections are prioritized over volume.

## Key Differentiators
- **50-50 Gender Ratio**: Strictly maintained through waitlist and invitation systems
- **Single Premium Tier**: All users get premium features - ₹5000/month for males, lifetime free for females
- **No Freemium Model**: No feature limitations, only payment differentiation by gender
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Limited daily matches and engagement mechanics
- **Anti-Overwhelm Design**: Preventing match fatigue for both genders
